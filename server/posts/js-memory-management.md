# JavaScript Memory Management â€” Lessons from C

While writing code in C for some time, I was tired of cleaning the memory each time to avoid memory leaks in my program. For someone who used to write code in dynamically typed, high-level languages like JavaScript, it was a real headache. Then, I decided to learn deeply how JavaScript is handling this issue.

## 1. Reachability Rules
Objects stay in memory only if theyâ€™re connected to **roots** (active functions, global variables, etc.).

---

## 2. Mark-and-Sweep Magic
JavaScript uses a **mark-and-sweep garbage collection algorithm**:  

- **Mark**: The garbage collector scans starting from roots, tagging every reachable object.  
- **Sweep**: Untagged objects get removed â€” no manual cleanup needed.  

---

## 3. No Orphaned Islands
Even complex object networks (like family trees) disappear if disconnected from roots.  
If nothing references them, theyâ€™re gone.

## The Best Part? Engine Optimizations
Modern JavaScript engines make garbage collection more efficient with:  

- **Generational handling** â†’ prioritizes short-lived objects (common in JS).  
- **Incremental collection** â†’ runs in small chunks to avoid freezing your app.

## Conclusion
JavaScript spares developers the pain of manual memory management, but understanding how it works helps you write better, memory-efficient code.
