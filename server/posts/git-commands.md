If you only use `git pull`, `git push`, and a few basic commands, youâ€™re missing out on the real power of Git.  
In this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through **some of the most useful advanced Git commands** that every developer should know.

## 1. `git stash`
When you need to quickly switch branches but donâ€™t want to commit unfinished work, `git stash` is your friend.  

- Temporarily saves your modifications  
- Keeps your working directory clean  
- You can reapply the changes later with:  

```bash
git stash pop
````

---

## 2. `git reset`

Use `git reset` to undo commits and move back to a specific commit.

Types of resets:

* **Soft reset** â€“ keeps changes staged

  ```bash
  git reset --soft <commit-hash>
  ```

* **Mixed reset** (default) â€“ keeps changes in working directory

  ```bash
  git reset --mixed <commit-hash>
  ```

* **Hard reset** â€“ discards all changes after the chosen commit

  ```bash
  git reset --hard <commit-hash>
  ```

---

## 3. `git rebase`

Rebasing moves commits to a new base commit. This helps create a **cleaner history** by avoiding merge commits.

Example:

```bash
git rebase main
```

---

## 4. `git bisect`

Finding the exact commit that introduced a bug can be painful. `git bisect` automates this using **binary search**.

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good <commit-hash>
```

Git will then guide you through testing commits until it pinpoints the culprit.

---

## 5. `git grep`

Search your repository for keywords, functions, or code snippets:

```bash
git grep "functionName"
```

This is much faster than manually scanning files or using a basic text search.

---

## 6. `git diff`

Compare changes before committing or pushing:

```bash
git diff
```

You can also compare branches or specific commits:

```bash
git diff branch1..branch2
```

Great for catching mistakes early.

## Final Thoughts

These are just a handful of powerful Git commands that can **save time, reduce errors, and make debugging easier**.
Mastering them will help you work faster and keep your project history clean.
