Hello everyone.

It’s been a long time since I last wrote something meaningful here. Recently, I’ve mostly been busy solving **LeetCode problems** and deep-diving into **data structures and algorithms**.

The industry is moving so fast that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with trends. The most important things, in my opinion, are **not losing motivation**, **continuously sharpening our knowledge**, and **enriching our toolbox**.

Nowadays, many people are doing so-called **“vibe coding,”** which gives a certain level of confidence that they can build things. However, we need to understand that **engineering is not just about coding** — it is much more than that.

It involves:
- Design  
- Architecture  
- Scalability  
- Performance  
- Business requirements  
- And much more  

That’s what I wanted to share.

**What’s your take on this? What are you working on these days?**
